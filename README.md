PMHVCIBYPASS is a specialized utility designed to bypass Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and Hypervisor Code Integrity (HVCI) checks on modern Windows systems. Commonly used in scenarios involving driver testing, security research, and compatibility testing, this cracked version removes licensing or activation requirements, offering unrestricted access to its full functionality.

⚙️ Key Features:
✅ TPM Bypass: Circumvents TPM 2.0 restrictions commonly enforced in Windows 11 environments.

✅ HVCI Disablement: Temporarily disables Hypervisor-protected Code Integrity for unsigned driver loading or kernel testing.

✅ One-Click Execution: Simplified interface for quick deployment, with minimal system footprint.

✅ Bypass Compatibility Checks: Useful for legacy systems or virtual machines that fail secure boot/TPM checks.

✅ No Activation Needed: Fully cracked version; no license key or internet connection required.

🧪 Use Cases:
🔬 Security researchers and reverse engineers working in isolated labs.

🖥️ Developers testing kernel-mode drivers without signing.

🧱 VM users facing Windows installation blockades due to missing TPM.

⚔️ Hackers and modders exploring system internals (for ethical purposes only).
